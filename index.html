			<h2>Question</h2>
			<p><u>How has life expectancy changed between 1900 and 2000?</u> We cannot exactly
				measure this from the data given, but we can approximate it by studying the age
				distribution in each time period. My sketches attempt to do this in three different
				ways.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="./figures/sketch_1.png" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 400px;" />
				<figcaption>
					Age distribution of the US population in 1900 and 2000. One hundred years ago,
					the population was primarily young, and living longer appears to have been a
					luxury, as the size of the age groups decreases uniformly with age.
					As of 2000, the distribution is wider and bimodal, with middle-aged
					adults comprisng the majority group.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Idea behind this sketch was to nod to traditional <a
					   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"
					   target="_blank">population pyramid</a> designs used in medicine, but
					intentionally make it an asymmetric pyramid</li>
				<li>This Design normalizes out sex differences (by lumping them together) and scale
					differences (by using percentages, not counts) to focus on distributional shape
				</li>
				<li>(Pro) The main advantage of this is it translates the statistical shapes of the
					populations into a physical
					shape, and visually contrasts them; you don't need to look at the numbers to see
					the difference</li>
				<li>(Pro) Naturally supports visual representations of summary statistics, like
					median markers for each year</li>
				<li>(Con) Loses some information about the scales of the populations; this
					information is still somewhat related to the question</li>
				<li>(Con) Might be confusing at first <i>because</i> it is a nontraditional use of a
					population pyramid</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="./figures/sketch_2.png" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 800px;" />
				<figcaption>
					Dot matrices for the US population in 1900 and 2000, broken down by stage of
					life. Very few people in this time period lived to be elderly, and most were
					young children or adults. In 2000, the population is much larger in scale, and
					elderly people comprise a much larger portion of it.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Previous sketch ignored scale; this vis very intentionally does not. Number of
					dots corresponds to population counts, hence many additional dots in 2000</li>
				<li>Uses a coarser age grouping (child, adult, elderly) because using all 5-year age
					groups would result in visual overload</li>
				<li>Still normalizes out sex information because it is not very relevant to the
					question</li>
				<li>(Pro) Communicates distributional information using color and
					pattern/repetition; again, reader would not need to look at numbers to get the
					point</li>
				<li>(Pro) Coarser age grouping is much simpler to understand</li>
				<li>(Pro) Visualizes the scale of the populations</li>
				<li>(Con) Normalizes out some important information, e.g. it wouldn't show the
					apparent
					bi-modal shape of the 2000 census data</li>
				<li>(Con) A little harder to visually represent summary stats</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="./figures/sketch_3.png" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 500px" />
				<figcaption>
					Change in the proportion of each age group in the US population form 1900 to
					2000, broken down by sex.
					Young to middle-aged adults have decreased in proportion, while the elderly
					population has increased substantially, likely due to the better life expectancy
					of the modern day. There are no noticeable differences between the sexes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Both previous plots ignored sex information and separately visualized each year.
					This sketch attempts to do both of those things differently</li>
				<li>Focuses specifically on the <i>change</i> in each age group over the century,
					with the goal of showing that concentration has shifted heavily toward an
					older/adult + elderly population</li>
				<li>Bar chart format naturally lends itself to stacking, so we can see changes in
					male and female subpopulations</li>
				<li>The focal point would be toward the end of the plot, where the increase in
					elderly population would be quite sharp</li>
				<li>(Pro) Bar charts are easy to parse, and there is low risk for visual overload
					here</li>
				<li>(Con) Deltas are confusing, especially in this stacked format; e.g., requires a
					lot of reflective processing to determine whether male or female changed more
				</li>
				<li>(Con) Would not easily support case where, e.g., percent of men increased but
					percent of women decreased, though I think this is unlikely</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				All three of my visualizations look quite different visually, and seem to tackle
				different aspects of my original question. The first visualization focuses on
				<i>distributions</i>, and really emphasizes shape in the visual design. The second
				incorporates scale and is pleasantly simple to look at. I also appreciate that this
				simplifies the age groupings into something that is easy to parse, but I worry that
				this will lose too much of the shape information that Sketch 1 captures. Finally,
				the third sketch really leans into the idea of <i>change</i>. While it's more
				detailed than the other plots, I think it's a bit too confusing.
				As I consider the first and second sketches together, I am drawn to the first
				because of how it draws from a very conventional and recognizable design, but
				changes
				it in an interesting way. Using shape as the key visual element feels like it
				resonates with the question I am asking, which is fundamentally about shape.
				To take it further, I think I would need to refine this design a bit: using density
				(area under curve) makes it harder to see the individual age groups, and there is
				room to show additional summary statistics on the plot.
